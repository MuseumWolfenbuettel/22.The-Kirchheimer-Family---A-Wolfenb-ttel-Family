            Dr. Siegfried Kirchheimer began practicing medicine in Wolfenbüttel in 1919. In 1926, he moved his practice to his newly built home on Schützenstraße 8, which was renumbered as 20 in the mid-1930s. Under the Nazi regime, Dr. Kirchheimer faced persecution as early as March 1933, when SA men, acting as auxiliary police, searched his house and confiscated World War I memorabilia, including an officer’s sword and his steel helmet.
In September 1938, like all Jewish physicians, Dr. Kirchheimer had his medical license revoked, forcing him to close his practice. The Kirchheimer family sought refuge with relatives in Bad Driburg while waiting for emigration permits for all family members. During Kristallnacht, Dr. Kirchheimer was arrested in Bad Driburg but narrowly avoided deportation to the Buchenwald concentration camp due to his advanced emigration application.
In November 1938, only Siegfried Kirchheimer and his daughter Lore initially received immigration permits to the United States. It was not until March 1941 that his wife Martha and their three children—Grete, Alice, and Hans—were finally granted visas, allowing the entire family to escape to the United States and survive.
In July 1992, the city council decided to name a street in Wolfenbüttel’s Auguststadt district, near his former practice, after Dr. Siegfried Kirchheimer, commemorating his legacy.
